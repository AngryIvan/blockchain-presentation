                        Most sources describe blockchain as a ledger of facts, replicated across several computers assembled in a peer-to-peer network. Facts can be anything from monetary transactions to content signature. Members of the network are anonymous individuals called
                        nodes. All communication inside the network takes advantage of cryptography to securely identify the sender and the receiver. When a node wants to add a fact to the ledger, a consensus forms in the network to determine where this
                        fact should appear in the ledger; this consensus is called a block. The blockchain database isn’t stored in any single location, meaning the records it keeps are truly public and easily verifiable. No centralized version of this
                        information exists for a hacker to corrupt. Hosted by millions of computers simultaneously, its data is accessible to anyone on the internet.

                        <p>Blockchain allows you to securely distribute and / or process data between multiple individuals through an untrusted network. Data can be anything, but the most interesting version of the data is the ability to transfer information,
                            which requires a third trusted party. Examples of such information are money (require the participation of a bank), property rights (require the participation of a notary), a loan agreement, etc. In essence, the blockchain
                            eliminates the need for a third proxy.</p>
                        <p>Chain itself consists of blocks that are connected by hashes like so:</p>
                        <p>Now imagine if the data in block 1 is altered. Let’s say that the transaction between Damian and George is altered and Damian now supposedly sent 500 Bitcoin to George instead of 100 Bitcoin. The string of data in block 1 is now
                            different, meaning the block also gets a new signature. The signature that corresponds with this new set of data is no longer X32. Let’s say it is now ‘W10’ instead. Here is what happens now:</p>
                        <p>Block 1 and 2 are now no longer chained to each other. This indicates to other users of this blockchain that some data in block 1 has been altered, and because the blockchain should be immutable, they reject this change by shifting
                            back to a previous record of the blockchain where all the blocks are still chained together. The only way that an alteration can stay undetected, is if all the blocks stay chained together. This means for the alteration to
                            go undetected, the new signature of block 1 must replace the old one in the data of block 2. The blocks on a blockchain are publicly available to anyone. So, if an alteration is supposed to stay undetected on a blockchain,
                            all the blocks need to stay properly chained together (otherwise people can tell that certain blocks don’t properly link to each other). This means that altering a single block requires a new signature for every other block
                            that comes after it all the way to the end of the chain. This is considered to be impossible.</p>

                        <p>For most of the world, blockchain is synonymous with Bitcoin. And that’s understandable, considering it was literally created for Bitcoin. But the applications of blockchain are far broader than cryptocurrencies. Industries like
                            financial services, healthcare, media, government, supply chain and logistics, IoT, asset management, and remittance services are natural applications for the technology.</p>

                        Now that I’ve told you all you need about blockchain I’m going to tell you all you need to build a simple blockchain yourself using JS. I will leave a link to the author at the end of the example. We will need npm to install CryproJS which is a library
                        of crypto standarts. We will use SHA256, it’s an encrypting algorithm that is used in Bitcoin.
